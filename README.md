# Fuel Consumption Predictor for Heavy Vehicles ðŸš›â›½

Welcome to the Fuel Consumption Predictor project! This machine learning app estimates the average fuel consumption (in liters per 100 km) of heavy vehicles using key parameters like kinetic energy, potential energy, speed, number of stops, and other important factors.

## Features

- **User-friendly web app** built with Streamlit for interactive fuel consumption prediction.
- **Explore the dataset** with overview stats, correlations, and data visualizations.
- **Detailed visuals** include feature distributions, scatter plots, and model-based feature importance.
- Easy to run locally or deploy on Streamlit Cloud.
